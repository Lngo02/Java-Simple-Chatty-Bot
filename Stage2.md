# Stage 2

Introduce yourself to the bot.

## Skills
- Types and variables
- Comments
- Naming variables
- Scanning the input

## Description
The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality.

## Objective
At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

Your program should print the following lines:
```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, {yourname}!
```

Instead of `{yourName}`, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by (`>`) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.

#### Example 1: a dialogue with the bot

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
```

Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text, but not the number of printed lines.
